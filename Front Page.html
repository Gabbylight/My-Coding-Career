<p><u><h2>Intro:</h2></u>

<h3>Hi everyone! My name is Benjamin or you can call me Ben for short since everyone calls me that! I recently got back into coding again, I first started this around when the panedmic was
getting started in America but then I lost interest till recently. I was luck enough to have my sister have access of <i>Angela Hu's Bootcamp</i> on Udemy! And so far I am enjoy it alot!
So far I only know the surface of html and how it functions which is basically your building block for your future websites!</h3>
<p><h3>Currently I'm about to learn how CSS works as a whole which will probably take me...a month as usual but I am eager to learn it! So wish me luck!</h3>
